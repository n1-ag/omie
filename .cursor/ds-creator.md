You are a **Design System Showcase Builder**.
You are given a reference website HTML:
$ARGUMENTS

Your task is to create **one new intermediate HTML file** that acts as a **living design
system + pattern library** for this exact design.

Generate **one single file** called: **design-system.html** and place it in the same folder of
the html file.

This file must preserve the **exact look & behavior** of the reference design by
**reusing the original HTML, CSS classes, animations, keyframes, transitions,
effects, and layout patterns** — not approximations.

Build a **single page** composed of **canonical examples** of the design system,
organized in sections.

# Extract HTML Design System v

## GOAL

## HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

```
 - Do not redesign or invent new styles.
 - Reuse exact class names, animations, timing, easing, hover/focus states.
 - Reference the same CSS/JS assets used by the original.
 - If a style/component is not used in the reference HTML, do not add it.
 - The file must be self-explanatory by structure (sections = documentation).
 - Include a top horizontal nav with anchor links to each section.
```

## OBJECTIVE

The **first section MUST be a direct clone of the original Hero** :

**Allowed change (only this):**

**Forbidden:**

Create a **Typography section** rendered as a **spec table / vertical list**.

Each row MUST contain:

Include ONLY styles that exist in the reference HTML, in this order:

## 0) Hero (Exact Clone, Text Adapted)

```
 - Same HTML structure
 - Same class names
 - Same layout
 - Same images and components
 - Same animations and interactions
 - Same buttons and background
 - Same UI components (if any)
```

```
Replace the hero text content to present the Design System
Keep similar text length and hierarchy
```

```
Do not change layout, spacing, alignment, or animations
Do not add or remove elements
```

## 1) Typography

```
Style name (e.g. “Heading 1”, “Bold M”)
Live text preview using the exact original HTML element and CSS classes
Font size / line-height label aligned right (format: 40 px / 48 px )
```

```
Heading 1
Heading 2
```

Rules:

This section must communicate **hierarchy, scale, and rhythm** at a glance.

```
Heading 3
Heading 4
Bold L / Bold M / Bold S
Paragraph (larger body, if exists)
Regular L / Regular M / Regular S
```

```
 - No inline styles
 - No normalization
 - Typography, colors, spacing, and gradients MUST come from original CSS
 - If a style uses gradient text, show it exactly the same
 - If a style does not exist, do NOT include it
```

## 2) Colors & Surfaces

```
Backgrounds (page, section, card, glass/blur if exists)
Borders, dividers, overlays
Gradients (as swatches + usage context)
```

## 3) UI Components

```
Buttons, inputs, cards, etc. (only those that exist)
Show states side-by-side: default / hover / active / focus / disabled
Inputs only if present (default/focus/error if applicable)
```

## 4) Layout & Spacing

```
Containers, grids, columns, section paddings
Show 2–3 real layout patterns from the reference (hero layout, grid, split)
```

Show all motion behaviors present:

Include a small **Motion Gallery** demonstrating each animation class.

If the reference uses icons:

If icons are not present, omit this section entirely.

## 5) Motion & Interaction

```
Entrance animations (if any)
Hover lifts/glows
Button hover transitions
Scroll/reveal behavior (only if present)
```

## 6) Icons

```
Display the same icon style/system
Show size variants and color inheritance
Use the same markup and classes
```
